This is a data set of online handwriting digits, taken from 44 writers with 250 samples each. The training and test set have been divided, with the training set almost twice as large as the test one.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/UJI+Pen+Characters
This is the first version of data of online handwriting characters and digits, containing upper and lower case English characters and digits from 11 writers, with each symbol occurring twice per writer. One file corresponds to one writer. Note that the y-axis is upside down, i.e. the coordinate decreases as the stylus moves up on the panel.

There is also a second version not used in the study and not included here.
