Preprocessing  
zooming out with less sampled pixels, multiscale (as in Yuanyuan Feng)  
randomly perturbing the entire path with rigid motions or pixels-by-pixels, regularization (as in Sam Cohn)  

Jumps  
fix/get around the degeneracy/spasity of jump-related tensors in signatures, and utilize the extra piece of information of jumps  
study the cost/benefit of extra dimension VS extra tensor power
